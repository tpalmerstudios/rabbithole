# rabbithole
A robust custom database system designed to seamlessly link and manage data using associations and relationships that allows the user to dive down a rabbit hole of associated data with a simple query

Rabbit Hole DB will be designed to create a highly flexible and scalable backend database capable of storing and managing a wide variety of data types. The key component is that no datum will be an island. All data is associated with its parents, children, siblings, and so forth. This will allow the frontend to display the various connections in a unique way. The frontend, on the other hand will be initially a test environment, but will eventually be a cross platform interface that focuses on interacting with homes, people, and vehicles. As the project evolves, the backend's flexibility will allow the integration of new data types and expanded functionality.
